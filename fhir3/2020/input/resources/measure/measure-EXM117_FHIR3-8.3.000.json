  "rationale": "Infants and toddlers are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases because their immune systems have not built up the necessary defenses to fight infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017a). Most childhood vaccines are between 90 and 99 percent effective in preventing diseases (HealthyChildren 2015). Vaccination of each U.S. birth cohort with the current childhood immunization schedule prevents approximately 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease and saves nearly $14 billion in direct costs and $69 billion in societal costs each year (Zhou 2014). Immunizing a child not only protects that child's health but also the health of the community, especially for those who are not immunized or are unable to be immunized due to other health complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017b). When the majority of the community is immunized against a disease, other members of the community are also protected because herd immunity shields them. (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 2014).",

Hepatitis B (HepB) \"Minimum age: birth\" \"Birth Dose (Monovalent HepB vaccine only): -- Mother is HBsAg-Negative: 1 dose within 24 hours of birth for medically stable infants >2,000 grams. Infants <2,000 grams administer 1 dose at chronological age 1 month or hospital discharge. -- Mother is HBsAg-Positive: Give HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of HBIG (at separate anatomic sites) within 12 hours of birth, regardless of birth weight. Test for HBsAg and anti-HBs at age 9–12 months. If HepB series is delayed, test 1–2 months after final dose. -- Mother’s HBsAg status is unknown: Give HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth, regardless of birth weight. For infants &lt;2,000 grams, give 0.5 mL of HBIG in addition to HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Determine mother’s HBsAg status as soon as possible. If mother is HBsAg-positive, give 0.5 mL of HBIG to infants >2,000 grams as soon as possible, but no later than 7 days of age.  Routine Series: -- A complete series is 3 doses at 0, 1–2, and 6–18 months. (Monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for doses given before age 6 weeks.) -- Infants who did not receive a birth dose should begin the series as soon as feasible. -- Administration of 4 doses is permitted when a combination vaccine containing HepB is used after the birth dose. -- Minimum age for the final (3rd or 4th) dose: 24 weeks. -- Minimum Intervals: Dose 1 to Dose 2: 4 weeks / Dose 2 to Dose 3: 8 weeks / Dose 1 to Dose 3: 16 weeks.

Prospectively: A 4th dose may be given as early as age 12 months if at least 6 months have elapsed since the 3rd dose. Retrospectively: A 4th dose that was inadvertently given as early as 12 months may be counted if at least 4 months have elapsed since the 3rd dose.\"  Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) \"Minimum age: 6 weeks\" \"Routine Vaccination:  -- ActHIB, Hiberix, or Pentacel: 4-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months. -- PedvaxHIB: 3-dose series at 2, 4, and 12–15 months.\" Polio (IPV) \"Minimum age: 6 weeks\" -- 4-dose series at ages 2, 4, 6–18 months, and 4–6 years.

  "guidance": "For the MMR, hepatitis B, VZV and hepatitis A vaccines, numerator inclusion criteria include: evidence of receipt of the recommended vaccine; documented history of the illness; or, a seropositive test result for the antigen. For the DTaP, IPV, HiB, pneumococcal conjugate, rotavirus, and influenza vaccines, numerator inclusion criteria include only evidence of receipt of the recommended vaccine.  Patients may be included in the numerator for a particular antigen if they had an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. Patients may be included in the numerator for the DTaP vaccine if they have encephalopathy. Patients may be included in the numerator for the IPV vaccine if they have had an anaphylactic reaction to streptomycin, polymyxin B, or neomycin. Patients may be included in the numerator for the influenza, MMR, or VZV vaccines if they have cancer of lymphoreticular or histiocytic tissue, multiple myeloma, leukemia, have had an anaphylactic reaction to neomycin, have Immunodefiency, or have HIV. Patients may be included in the numerator for the hepatitis B vaccine if they have had an anaphylactic reaction to common baker's yeast.  The measure allows a grace period by measuring compliance with these recommendations between birth and age two.",
