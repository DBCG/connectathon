  "rationale": "The effectiveness of antithrombotic agents in reducing stroke mortality, stroke-related morbidity and recurrence rates has been studied in several large clinical trials. While the use of these agents for patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks continues to be the subject of study, substantial evidence is available from completed studies. Data at this time suggest that antithrombotic therapy should be prescribed at discharge following acute ischemic stroke to reduce stroke mortality and morbidity as long as no contraindications exist.\n\nFor patients with a stroke due to a cardioembolic source (eg atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve), warfarin is recommended unless contraindicated. In recent years, novel oral anticoagulant agents (NOACs) have been developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention, and may be considered as an alternative to warfarin for select patients. Anticoagulation therapy is not generally recommended for secondary stroke prevention in patients presumed to have a non-cardioembolic stroke.\nAnticoagulants at doses to prevent venous thromboembolism are insufficient antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA.",
