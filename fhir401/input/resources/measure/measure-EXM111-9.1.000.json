The calculation requires the median across all ED encounter durations.",
  "rationale": "Reducing the time patients remain in the emergency department (ED) can improve access to treatment and increase quality of care. Reducing this time potentially improves access to care specific to the patient condition and increases the capability to provide additional treatment. In recent times, EDs have experienced significant overcrowding. Although once only a problem in large, urban, teaching hospitals, the phenomenon has spread to other suburban and rural healthcare organizations. According to a 2002 national U.S. survey, more than 90 percent of large hospitals report EDs operating 'at' or 'over' capacity. Approximately one third of hospitals in the U.S. report increases in ambulance diversion in a given year, whereas up to half report crowded conditions in the ED. In a recent national survey, 40 percent of hospital leaders viewed ED crowding as a symptom of workforce shortages. ED crowding may result in delays in the administration of medication such as antibiotics for pneumonia and has been associated with perceptions of compromised emergency care. For patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, long ED stays were associated with decreased use of guideline-recommended therapies and a higher risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Overcrowding and heavy emergency resource demand have led to a number of problems, including ambulance refusals, prolonged patient waiting times, increased suffering for those who wait, rushed and unpleasant treatment environments, and potentially poor patient outcomes. When EDs are overwhelmed, their ability to respond to community emergencies and disasters may be compromised.",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "The most common cause of ED crowding is the boarding of admitted patients in the ED. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential for errors, life threatening delays in treatment, and diminished overall quality is enormous.",

An Order- A) admission order (this may be an operational order rather than the hospital admission to inpatient status order), B) disposition order (must explicitly state to admit), C) documented bed request, or D) documented acceptance from admitting physician. This is not the 'bed assignment time' or 'report called time'. Or \r\n2. An Assessment- an ED evaluation that results in a decision to 'Admit Inpatient' \r\nThe decision to admit inpatient must be performed during the ED visit that is within 1 hour of the inpatient admission and prior to the patient departing the ED. \r\nThe specification provides elements from the clinical electronic record required to calculate the median time, i.e., the duration from the decision to admit to the time the patient physically departed the ED. \r\nThis eCQM is an episode-based measure. \r\n This version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.5.
